### How to customize the aah application version during a build?

aah CLI command `build` process the application version in the following order-

1. Environment variable - `AAH_APP_VERSION`.
2. Git short commit-sha using command `git describe` (if project uses git VCS).
3. `version` config value from file `aah.project`.

### How to customize the aah application Build Timestamp during a build?

aah CLI command `build` process the application build timestamp in the following order-

1. Environment variable - `AAH_APP_BUILD_TIMESTAMP`.
2. Environment variable - `AAH_APP_BUILD_DATE` (Deprecated, do not use).
3. Creates build time stamp in the format of `RFC3339`.

### How to update aah to latest version?

#### Install/Update aah CLI

aah user have multiple ways to update CLI easily.

##### Via Installer

<span class="badge lb-sm">Since v0.12.0</span> aah provides easy way to install CLI.

```bash
$ curl https://aahframework.org/install-cli | bash
#	OR
$ wget -qO- https://aahframework.org/install-cli | bash
```

##### Via Homebrew - macOS and Linux

<span class="badge lb-sm">Since v0.11.0</span> aah provides Homebrew support.

```bash
# First install
$ brew install go-aah/tap/aah

# If aah is already installed, do
$ brew upgrade aah
```

#### Update aah framework

##### Go Modules (go.mod)

```bash
# Go to aah aplication base directory and run
env GO111MODULE=on go get aahframe.work@latest
```

##### For v0.11.4 and below (Deprecated)

```bash
go get -u aahframework.org/aah.v0

# To update aah CLI and framework in GOPATH.
go get -u aahframework.org/tools.v0/aah

# To update aah framework using package management tool, refer to the respective tool documentation. 
# Example: `glide update`
```

### Does aah support Package Management Tools?

<span class="badge lb-sm">Since v0.12.0</span> aah adapts and fully supports Go Modules. `go.mod` is a aah's officially supported package management tool. Refer to `go help modules` and `go help mod`.

##### For v0.11.4 and below (Deprecated)

Yes, of course. As described in [versioning documentation](versioning.html#package-management). aah works seamlessly with pacakge manangement tool (like `glide`, `dep`, `govendor`, etc).

For example: I have responded to aah user for `dep` tool, refer to [GitHub comment]({{aah_issues_url}}/109#issuecomment-327225582).

### How to adapt to latest aah configuration?

The best way is to have a look at aah documentation https://docs.aahframework.org on respective configuration docs.

### How to try aah edge version?

<span class="badge lb-sm">Since v0.12.0</span> aah user could use Go Modules to get the `edge` version like -

```bash
# Go to aah aplication base directory and run
env GO111MODULE=on go get aahframe.work@edge
```

##### For v0.11.4 and below (Deprecated)

Of-course you can. <span class="badge lb-sm">Since v0.9</span> `aah switch` command makes it very easy to try edge version. Learn more, run `aah help switch`.

Just run the below command and then run your app as usual using `aah run`:

```bash
# Switches to latest edge version
aah switch   

# Switching back to stable release version
aah switch --value release

# If you're already on aah edge version, 
# you could refresh to get latest edge codebase
aah switch --refresh
```

### How to log all goroutine stacktrace?

It is very simple to do in aah. Just set the below config to true.

```bash
runtime {
  debug {
    # Whether to collect all the Go routines details or not.
    # Default value is `false`
    all_goroutines = true
  }
}
```

### Does aah has benchmark against other Go web framework?

Well, aah goal is to achieve full stack (yet micro framework nature) web framework capabilities for modern Web, API and WebSocket applications with best performance. ***Also I'm keep-on optimizing aah on every release, its getting better and better*** ðŸ˜Ž.

I have submitted aah benchmark application to community driven benchmark group called [TechEmpower](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=code&hw=ph). Results of [Round 17 - aah v0.11.4](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=fortune&l=zijocf-1). It is benchmarked with ***6 simple use case***. Obviously it will not fit for every use case, however benchmark results certainly does provide prespective.

<div class="alert alert-info-blue">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please keep in mind, performance is subjective when comes to each use case, implementation, environment, network, etc. I would request aah user do performance/load testing for their application use case respectively and let me know if you hit bottle neck.</p>
</div>

### Does aah supports Hot-Reload for Development?

Yes, aah detects the file change(s) on aah project then it automatically stops the server, builds it and start the server with updated codebase.

<div class="alert alert-info-blue">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Static file and template file changes reflects without aah server restart; server is restarted only for Go Source code.</p>
</div>

### Is posting an arbitrary CSRF token pair (cookie and POST data) a vulnerability?

No, this is by design. Without a man-in-the-middle attack, there is no way for an attacker to send a Anti-CSRF token cookie to a victim's browser, so a successful attack would need to obtain the victim's browser's cookie via XSS or similar, in which case an attacker usually doesn't need CSRF attacks.

Some security audit tools flag this as a problem but as mentioned before, an attacker cannot steal a user's browser's Anti-CSRF cookie. "Stealing" or modifying your own token using Firebug, Chrome dev tools, etc. isn't a vulnerability.

### Is it a problem that aah's Anti-CSRF protection isn't linked to a session?

No, this is by design. Not linking CSRF protection to a session allows using the protection on sites such as a pastebin that allow submissions from anonymous users which donâ€™t have a session.

### Why might a user encounter a Anti-CSRF validation failure after logging in?

For security reasons, Anti-CSRF tokens are rotated each time a user logs in. Any page with a form generated before a login will have an old, invalid Anti-CSRF token and need to be reloaded. This might happen if a user uses the back button after a login or if they login in a different browser tab.
