# i18n - Internalization & Localization

i18n library provides internalization and localization feature for aah application.

  * Message file format is `forge` [config syntax](configuration.html) which is similar to HOCON syntax not 100%.
  * Message filename format is `message.<Language-ID>`. Language ID is combination of `Language + Region` or `Language` value. Language code is as per two-letter `ISO 639-1` standard and Region code is as per two-letter `ISO 3166-1` standard.

```bash
Supported message file extension formats are (in-casesensitive)
  1) Language + Region => en-us | en-US
  2) Language          => en

For Example:
  message.en-US or message.en-us
  message.en-GB or message.en-gb
  message.en-CA or message.en-ca
  message.en
  message.es
  message.zh
  message.nl
  etc.
```

aah framework supports sub-directories under `<app-base-dir>/i18n/...`, so feel free to organize your message files as per your need.

## Message Lookup Strategy

i18n message lookup strategy by key as follows.

#### Scenario 1

Input Locale is `en-US` and message key is `label.page.index.title`.

  * First it looks up `i18n` store by given locale `Language + Region` value if found then returns it
  * Second if not found then it looks up by `Language` only if found then return it.
  * Third if not found then it looks up by `i18n.default` config value if found then return it.
  * Otherwise it returns `empty` string and logs the `msg key` as not found.

#### Scenario 2

Input Locale is `en` and message key is `label.page.index.title`.

  * First it looks up `i18n` store by `Language` value if found then return it.
  * Second if not found then it looks up by `i18n.default` config value if found then return it.
  * Otherwise it returns `empty` string and logs the `message key` as not found.
