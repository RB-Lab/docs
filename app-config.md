# aah Application Configuration

The configuration syntax is used by aah framework is very similar to HOCON syntax and not 100%. To learn more about **[configuration syntax](configuration.html)**.

aah configuration structure is very flexible, you can override every config settings in environment profiles.

Reference to [Routes Config](routes-config.html), [Security Config](security-config.html), [Log Config](log-config.html).

Have a look at [aahframework.org app configuration](https://github.com/go-aah/website/blob/master/config/aah.conf). It is moderate one, it gives an idea on how you can do it for your application.

## name

```bash
desc = "aah framework web application"
```

```

### key
HTTP server key file. Path to the key file. It is required if `server.ssl.enable` is `true`.

Default value is `empty` string.

```

### disable_http2
Go lang by default enables the HTTP/2 on TLS. For some reason your use case needs disabling HTTP/2; not to worry, aah framework covers you. Just set this config value to false.

Default value is `false`.

```bash
disable_http2 = true
```

### Section: lets_encrypt { ... }

### enable
To enable Let's Encrypt CA auto SSL/TLS certs on the aah server.

Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), they provide free digital certificates in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.

Default value is `false`. Don't forget to enable `server.ssl.enable = true`.
```bash
enable = true
```

### host_policy
Host policy controls which domains the `autocert` will attempt to retrieve new certificates for. It does not affect cached certs. It is array of domain/sub-domain names.

It is required, no default value.
```bash
host_policy = ["example.org", "docs.example.org"]
```

### renew_before
Renew before optionally specifies how early certificates should be renewed before they expire.

Default value is `10` days.
```bash
renew_before = 10
```

### email

Default value is `empty` string.
```bash
email = "jeeva@myjeeva.com"
```

### force_rsa
Force RSA makes the `autocert` generate certificates with 2048-bit RSA keys. If false, a default is used.

Default is `EC`-based keys using the `P-256` curve.
```bash
force_rsa = false
```

### cache_dir
Cache optionally stores and retrieves previously-obtained certificates autocert manager. By default certs will only be cached for the lifetime of the autocert manager.

Autocert manager passes the Cache certificates data encoded in PEM, with private/public parts combined in a single Cache.Put call, private key first.

Default value is `empty` string.
```bash
cache_dir = "/path/to/store/cache/certs"
```

---

## Section: request { ... }
Request configuration values.

### multipart_size
Request Multi-part size is used for form parsing when request `Content-Type` is `multipart/form-data`.

Default value is `32mb`.
```bash
multipart_size = "32mb"
```

### Section: id { ... }
aah framework encourages to have unique `Request Id` for each incoming request, it helps in tracebility. If request has already `X-Request-Id` HTTP header then it does not generate one.

Global unique identifier (GUID) generate implementation is based on [Mango DB ObjectId algorithm](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/).

* 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch,
* 3-byte machine identifier,
* 2-byte process id, and
* 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.

### enable
To enable/disable request ID generation.

Default value is `true`.
```bash
enable = true
```

### header

Default value is `en`.
```bash
default = "en"
```

---

## Section: format { ... }

```

### datetime

Whether to collect all the Go routines details or not.

Default value is `false`.

Default value is `empty` string.
```bash
default = "json"
```

### pretty
Pretty print option is helpful in `dev` environment profile. It is only applicable to JSON and XML.

Default value is `false`.
```bash
pretty = true
```

### Section: gzip { ... }

### enable
By default Gzip compression is enabled in aah framework, however framework ensures HTTP client does accepts Gzip response otherwise it won't use Gzip compression.

Tips: If you have `nginx` or `apache` web server enabled with gzip in-front of aah server then set this value to `false`.

Default value is `true`.
```bash
enable = true
```

### level

### case_sensitive
Whether you need a case sensitive view file resolve or not.

Default value is `false`.

```

---

## Section: env { ... }

## active
Indicates active profile name for application configuration.

Default value is `dev`.
```bash
active = "dev"
```

## include - This is for example purpose, you can use `include` at levels
Including all the environment profile overrides from `env` directory within config.
```bash
include "./env/*.conf"
```
