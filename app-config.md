# aah Application Configuration

The configuration syntax is used by aah framework is very similar to HOCON syntax. To learn more about **[configuration syntax](configuration.html)**.

aah configuration structure is very flexible it is called as `aah.conf`. You can override every config value in the environment profiles.

You can add your custom config values into app config. Also it can be overridden in the environment profiles.

Reference to [Routes Config](routes-config.html), [Security Config](security-config.html), [Log Config](log-config.html).

Have a look at [aahframework.org app configuration](https://github.com/go-aah/website/blob/master/config/aah.conf). It is moderate one, it gives an idea on how you can do it for your application.

Default value is `false`.

```bash
disable_http2 = true
```

### Section: lets_encrypt { ... }

### enable
To enable Let's Encrypt CA auto SSL/TLS certs on the aah go server.

Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), they provide free digital certificates in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.

Default value is `false`. Don't forget to enable `server.ssl.enable = true`.
```bash
enable = true
```

### host_policy
Host policy controls which domains the `autocert` will attempt to retrieve new certificates for. It does not affect cached certs. It is array of domain and sub-domain names.

It is required, no default value.

Default value is `empty` string.
```bash
email = "jeeva@myjeeva.com"

```bash
force_rsa = false
```

### cache_dir
Cache optionally stores and retrieves previously-obtained certificates autocert manager. By default certs will only be cached for the lifetime of the autocert manager.

Default value is `32mb`.
```bash
multipart_size = "32mb"
```

### Section: id { ... }
aah framework encourages to have unique `Request Id` for each incoming request, it is helpful for traceability. If request already has `X-Request-Id` HTTP header then it does not generate one.

Global Unique Identifier (GUID) generate implementation is based on [Mango DB ObjectId algorithm](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/).

* 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch,
* 3-byte machine identifier,
* 2-byte process id, and
* 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.

### enable
To enable/disable request ID generation.

Default value is `true`.
```bash
enable = true
```

### header

Default value is `X-Request-Id`.
```bash
header = "X-Request-Id"
```

---

## Section: i18n { ... }
Internationalization and Localization configuration values.

Default value is `en`.
```bash
default = "en"
```

---

## Section: format { ... }
Date and time format values. This is used by framework while parsing HTTP request parameters and DB store/retrieve operation `(upcoming)`.

date = "2006-01-02"
```

### datetime

Default value is `2mb`.
```bash
stack_buffer_size = "2mb"
```

### all_goroutines
Whether to collect all the Go routines details or not.

Default value is `false`.
```bash

```

### Section: pooling { ... }
Pooling configuration is used to reduce GC overhead from framework. Tune these value based on your use case. Pool doesn't create object unless it's needed.

Default value is `500`.
```bash
global = 500
```

### buffer
Used for `bytes.Buffer`.

Default value is `200`.
```bash
buffer = 200

## Section: render { ... }

### default
aah framework identifies the `Content-Type` value automatically. If `aah.Reply()` builder value is not set. It identifies in the order of:

  * Based on URL file extension, supported `.html`, `.htm`, `.json`, `.js`, `.xml` and `.txt`
  * Request Accept Header - Most Qualified one as per [RFC7321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3)
  * Config `render.default` value supported types are `html`, `json`, `xml` and `text`
  * Finally aah framework uses `http.DetectContentType` method

Default value is `empty` string.
```bash
default = "json"
```

### pretty
Pretty print option is very helpful in `dev` environment profile. It is only applicable to JSON and XML Content-Type.

Default value is `false`.
```bash
pretty = true
```

### Section: gzip { ... }
Gzip compression configuration for HTTP response.

### enable
By default Gzip compression is enabled in aah framework, however framework ensures HTTP client does accepts Gzip response otherwise it won't use the Gzip compression.

**Tips:** If you have `nginx` or `apache` web server enabled with gzip in-front of aah go server then set this value to `false`.

Default value is `true`.
```bash
enable = true
```

### level

Default value is `5`.
```bash
level = 3
```

---

## Section: view { ... }

```bash
engine = "go"
```

### ext

Default value is `html`.
```bash
ext = ".html"
```

### case_sensitive
Whether you need a case sensitive view file resolve or not.

Default value is `false`.
```bash

Default value is `{{.}}`
```bash
delimiters = "{{.}}"
```

### default_layout
By default aah framework chooses the default app layout as `master.html` if you do not provide one. However you may have a need that certain pages without layout. So use this option to disable the default layout for HTML rendering.

_**Note:**_ With this setting you can still use layouts, just provide layout name via `Reply().HTMLlf` or `Reply().HTMLl` methods.

Default value is `true`. Available since `v0.6`.
```bash
default_layout = false
```

---

## Section: env { ... }

## active
Indicates active profile name for application configuration.

Default value is `dev`.
```bash
active = "dev"
```

## include - This is for example purpose, you can use `include` at any levels
Including all the environment profile overrides from `env` directory within `config` directory.
