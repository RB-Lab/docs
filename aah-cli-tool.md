## Commands

The best way to learn about aah CLI commands is to run `aah help` and explore further:

  * For command - `aah help <command>` 
  * Also for sub-commands - `aah <command> help` or `aah <command> help <sub-command>`

### Command: aah help

Of-course name speaks for itself.

## Cross Compile Build

Set environment variables `GOOS` and `GOARCH` before executing `aah build` command. List of available GOOS and GOARCH values, [click here](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment).

#### Building linux binary on macOS

```bash
# Use `aah help build` to learn more
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 aah build --single --output /Users/jeeva/build

# Output:
...
Application artifact is here: /Users/jeeva/build/myapp-99bf7df-linux-amd64.zip
```

#### Building Windows .exe on macOS

```bash
# Use `aah help build` to learn more
env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 aah build --output /Users/jeeva/build

# Output:
...
Application artifact is here: /Users/jeeva/build/myapp-99bf7df-windows-amd64.zip
```
